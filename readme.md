# This repo is now _deprecated_

Why? Because GitHub is now owned by Microsoft. Microsoft has done a fine job of putting on the "we love open source" marketing dance. While I believe they're doing great things with Open Source, it'll take more than VSCode to convince me that their intentions are in the best interests of free software.

This repo will now be maintained on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/trev-dev/flask-starter)
